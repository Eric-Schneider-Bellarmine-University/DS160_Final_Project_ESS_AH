# DS160_Final_Project_ESS_AH

This paper explores a diabetic data csv file from a Machine Learning Repository. It is diabetic data from 130 hospitals in the United States. The paper talks about the goals and hypothesis of this entire project. This project goes through of the background of the original diabetic data and why it was made in the first place. It goes through the graphs and tables of the dataset. It talks about methods during the experiments and certain tools used too. It also talks about several problems encountered when working with this dataset because it is impossible if you get no error at all, so it talks about those problems in details. This paper then explores the results that we came with and discusses them as well as comparisons made between models and results. Finally, it goes through future work or if any improvements need to be made whether it is an improvement for people who want to create a dataset like this one or improvements to the models themselves.
